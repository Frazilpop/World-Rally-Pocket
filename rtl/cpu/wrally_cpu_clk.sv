// World Rally (Pocket) — the 68000's clock: 12 MHz of board time.
//
// The real board has no wait states; here the program comes from SDRAM. So
// the 68000 is never shown one: while a ROM read waits for its line the CPU
// is simply not clocked, and the clocks it missed are owed to it (credit,
// 12 per 48 MHz clocks) and given back at up to 24 MHz once the data is in.
// Seen from the CPU every bus cycle takes four clocks, as in MAME.
//
// `tick` marks each 68000 clock given. Everything that must keep step with
// the program -- the DS5002FP, the vblank IRQ -- counts ticks rather than
// 48 MHz clocks, so the three stay in lockstep (MAME's perfect quantum)
// however long the SDRAM takes; board time trails wall time by the credit
// owed, a few microseconds at most.
//
// The credit holds 4,095 ticks. When the SDRAM's waits outrun the catch-up
// for longer than that (the power-on ROM test, at a line latency of 14
// clocks or more), board time drops the clocks it cannot give and marks
// each with `lost`: the CPUs run that much slower, as an overloaded board
// would, and the vblank IRQ counts the lost clocks as given, so it stays on
// the picture's vblank.
//
// Replaces jlrh's wrally_68kdtack (jtframe's 68000 cen/DTACK with
// recovery), whose catch-up gives back cycles but not the 68000's timing:
// measured against MAME on World Rally 2's board, its CPU fell 3.4% behind
// and took IRQs on other instructions. From World Rally 2 Pocket's
// wrally2_cpu_clk, at 12 MHz instead of 13.
