# ---------------------------------------------------------- clock groups
#
# clk_74a (bridge, pad bus, I2S) is the PLL's reference but is treated as
# unrelated to its outputs: 48/74.25 = 64/99, so a "synchronous" analysis
# would find a worst-case edge pair a fraction of a nanosecond apart and fail
# paths that are in fact crossed by synchronisers, dcfifos and dual-clock
# RAMs, and never by plain logic. Every one of them is listed in core_top.v.
#
# The PLL outputs are ONE group and are timed against each other, because
# three crossings depend on it:
#
#   48 <-> 96   kaneko_sdram_x2: the 2:1 pair from one VCO, edges aligned,
#               not a CDC. Cut these and the adapter's assumptions go untimed.
#   48 -> 8     pocket_video: `hold` (48 MHz, loaded on ce_pix) sampled on
#               every 8 MHz edge. Every 8 MHz edge coincides with a 48 MHz
#               edge, so this is a normal synchronous path with a 20.8 ns
#               setup relationship and a 0 ns hold relationship. Timing it is
#               what makes "an 8 MHz edge on the reload edge sees the old
#               pixel" true in silicon, not just in the RTL comment.
#   96 -> pin   the SDRAM I/O below, against dram_clk_pin.

# READ DATA, AND WHY IT IS A TWO-CYCLE PATH.
#
# Data appears tAC after a device clock edge, and the device clock is half a
# period behind clk_sdram plus the I/O cell's output delay. The default
# analysis would latch it on the very next clk_sdram edge — half a period
# after launch — which nothing could meet. It is captured one full cycle later
# instead: a launch on dram_clk_pin at t is latched by clk_sdram at t + 1.5T.
# Measured from the READ command, that is the fourth clk_sdram edge into dq_r,
# which is cap_depth = CL + 3, i.e. kaneko_sdram's rd_lat_sel = 3 — the menu's
# default (core_top.v, RD_LAT_0). If this constraint passes, the default is
# the right edge on paper; the other menu entries move the edge by whole
# cycles for a board that disagrees with the paper, as upstream's did.
