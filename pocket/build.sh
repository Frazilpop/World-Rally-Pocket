# World Rally for Analogue Pocket — build the bitstream.
#
#   pocket/build.sh            build
#   pocket/build.sh --clean    empty db/ and incremental_db/ first, so smart
#                              recompilation cannot skip a stage
#
# Runs Quartus Prime Lite 21.1 in Docker (raetro/quartus:21.1, linux/amd64),
# here under Colima with Rosetta. The WHOLE repository is mounted, because the
# project in pocket/src/fpga reaches ../../../rtl, ../../../third_party and
# ../../../build/gen. Colima shares $HOME only — a checkout under /tmp would
# mount as empty.
#
# Before Quartus, on the Mac: jt8051's microcode (tools/gen_jt8051.sh, which
# needs Go, not in the Docker image) is made into build/gen, and the files the
# RTL reads with $readmem relative to the project directory -- jt8051.uc and
# fx68k's microrom.mem and nanorom.mem -- are copied next to ap_core.qpf
# (gitignored). jt6295 must carry the two fixes in tools/patches/ (applied by
# tools/bootstrap.sh); without them the build refuses to start.
#
# Generated files stay under build/ (the repo's rule): db/, incremental_db/
# and output_files/ in the project directory are symlinks into
# build/pocket/quartus/, made here on first use. The one exception is Analogue's
# own pre-flow script, which writes apf/build_id.mif with the build date at the
# start of every compile; it is ignored, not tracked, so a build leaves the
# tree clean.
#
# Afterwards: the fit, the RAM blocks by instance and the worst slack per
# clock are printed, and only if every clock meets timing is the
# bit-reversed bitstream the Pocket loads written to
# pocket/dist/Cores/frazilpop.World Rally/bitstream.rbf_r. On negative slack
# the script fails and leaves dist alone; the bitstream it made is kept as
# build/pocket/quartus/bitstream.rbf_r.failed for a look.
